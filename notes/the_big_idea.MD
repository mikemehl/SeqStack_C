# The Big Idea

Alright....a stack machine....but it's only output is through....OTHER STACKS.

Specifically, 8 "ports", each holding 8 "stacks" with limited entries.

All values are 16.8 bit fixed point.

Originally thought to use for making weird musical sequences....but....let's just focus on making a quirky stack machine.

"Do one thing, and do it well."

Our one thing will be providing a minimal programmable sequence generator.
